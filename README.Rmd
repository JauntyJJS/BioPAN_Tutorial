# BioPAN_Tutorial

This is the source code for this [web page](https://jauntyjjs.github.io/BioPAN_Tutorial/)
The goal of BioPAN_Tutorial is to show how BioPAN works with a small running example.

## Render into html document

There is an R script, [utils/render.R](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/BioPAN_Tutorial/tree/master/utils/render.R), that contains the lines to render everything in its correct location. So, when you have the "index.Rmd" file opened (and your working directory is at its root), simply run **`source("utils/render.R")`** in the console (or the relevant lines in that file). This will run the rendering file and create all the files.
