  abstract = {Recent advances in lipidomics tools and software assist in the identification and quantification of lipid species detected by mass spectrometry. By integrating mass spectrometric lipid data into mapped pathways and databases, an entire network of lipid species which both demonstrates the complexity of lipid structures and biochemical interactions can be constructed. Here we demonstrate lipidomics analysis at both systematic and molecular levels. This review focuses on four points: how lipid data can be collected and processed with the support of tools, software and databases; how lipidomic analysis is performed at the molecular level; how to integrate data analysis into a biological context; how the results of such analysis predict enzyme activities and potential sites for therapeutic interventions or manipulation of enzyme activities.}

  abstract = "{A major challenge for lipidomic analyses is the handling of the large amounts of data and the translation of results to interpret the involvement of lipids in biological systems.We built a new lipid ontology (LION) that associates \\&gt;50,000 lipid species to biophysical, chemical, and cell biological features. By making use of enrichment algorithms, we used LION to develop a web-based interface (LION/web, www.lipidontology.com) that allows identification of lipid-associated terms in lipidomes. LION/web was validated by analyzing a lipidomic dataset derived from well-characterized sub-cellular fractions of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Comparison of isolated plasma membranes with the microsomal fraction showed a significant enrichment of relevant LION-terms including “plasma membrane", “headgroup with negative charge", "glycerophosphoserines", “above average bilayer thickness", and “below average lateral diffusion". A second validation was performed by analyzing the membrane fluidity of Chinese hamster ovary cells incubated with arachidonic acid. An increase in membrane fluidity was observed both experimentally by using pyrene decanoic acid and by using LION/web, showing significant enrichment of terms associated with high membrane fluidity ("above average", "very high", and "high lateral diffusion" and "below average transition temperature").The results demonstrate the functionality of LION/web, which is freely accessible in a platform-independent way.}",
